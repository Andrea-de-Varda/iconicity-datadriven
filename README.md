# iconicity-datadriven
Materials for deriving data-driven iconicity measurements in the auditory modality. 

- The scripts for generating the sound embeddings from the VGGish network are in the VGGish_iconicity_sound.py file
- The ones based on the SpeechVGG architecture are in SpeechVGG_iconicity_sound.py
- The scripts for correlating them with human ratings are in Correlations_iconicity_sounds.py

A dataframe reporting the iconicity scores obtained with our experiments, as well as the human ratings employed for the validation (Winter et al., 2017, 2022), are reported in the folder **additional-data**.
